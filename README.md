#Endomondo track export

Endomondo it's great app, but don't allow download all tracks at once. I wrote simple script to do it.

It's my first trial in writing something useful in python :)

Script requires requests, you can install it from pip

    pip install requests

Usage: 
    ./export.py email password path_to_save(optional)
